# Description

This artifact contains source code to our two proposed scheme Pirex and Pirex+


### Security, Privacy, and Ethical Concerns
Our implementation uses common `rust` modules from standard `crates.io`
which is automatically managed by `cargo` package manager. In addition,
we use standard cryptographic library `libsecp256k1` from `bitcoin-core` 
which only requires `libtool`, `automake`, `build-essential` for compile 
process and can be easily installed via package management tools (e.g. 
apt on Ubuntu). The execution of this artifact does not pose any risks 
to the evaluatorsâ€™ system security, data privacy, or ethical concerns.

# Basic Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- A laptop with `x86_64` bit architecture with at least 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM and 
1TB storage.

- Our artifact can automatically make use RAM resource (upto 1TB) 
to accelerate the server performance.

### Network Expectation

Our artifact supports network connection between client and server through
TCP stream, which can be adjusted for both remote and local testing.

To make measurement match our main results and claims, we expect the 
network bandwidth will be around 40~45 Mbps.


### Software Requirements

All required `rust` modules and `libsecp256k1` source codes have
already been incorporated into the current artifact.


### Estimated Time and Storage Consumption

This artifact contains the implementation of two schemes Pirex and Pirex+.
Each scheme has two phases to be evaluated: 
- (1) Offline: can take about 01 human days per scheme for full evaluation.
- (2) Online: can take about 05 human hours per scheme for full evaluation.

Since an offline phase in our schemes is just an one-time preprocessing,
we have provided instructions so that the offline phase can be skipped
but still allow the full evaluation of the online phase in our schemes.

The total required storage size for full evaluation is under 1TB 
(max database setting in our schemes).

# Environment 

In this section, we describe the component of our artifact and how 
to verify that everything is set up correctly.

### Accessibility

Our artifact is entirely hosted on this github repository.


### Directory Structure

From the root, we have three directories:
1. `results` is where we store all performace breakdown results.
2. `secp256k1` is where we store our customized `libsecp256k1` library.
3. `src` is where we store the codes for our proposed schemes.
4. `utils` is where we store helper data and cpp function.

### Setup Environment

To configure the correct `rust` version:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-09-24
rustup default nightly-2023-09-24
```


### Install Dependency

For `pirex+`, we have customized `libsecp256k1` library and put
under `secp256k1` folder.

Before being able to compile our `libsecp256k1`, you may need to 
install some building libraries as follow:

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool
```

After checking all requirements, move into `secp256k1` for compilation.

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```

If successfully, we will see the static binary `libsecp256k1.a`
under subfolder `secp256k1/.libs`, which will be used
when we build our main source code in rust.

`libsecp256k1.a` will need a precomputed discrete log table.

To save time, you can download it from: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/09dufxsm3qc4nnemdqgpv/dlp.bin?rlkey=rtcq1banfpl0cehdd2oa1b7zy&st=rfhznwre&dl=1

```
curl -L -o dlp.bin <the_above_link>
```

Move `dlp.bin` into `utils` folder in the root.


### Configure & Build

1. Edit `SERVER_ADDRESS` inside `src/libs.rs` (We use localhost as default)

2. Check if environment is configured correctly for automate compilation:

```
python3 config.py 64 22
cargo build --release
```

If the artifact is correctly builded, you should see the following output:

```
warning: secp256k1 library path: <your_home_path>/pirex/secp256k1/.libs
```

The above commands are the first step to help us to test the performance
on a database of $2^{22}$ records, each of size 04KiB. 

Our artifact divide blocksize to multiple chunks of 64 bytes. Thus:
- 04KiB = 4096 bytes --> input `64` chunks
- 64KiB = 65536 bytes --> input `1024` chunks
- 256KiB = 262144 bytes --> input `4096` chunks

# Artifact Evaluation

In this section, we include all the steps required to evaluate our artifact's 
functionality and validate our paper's key results and claims.

### Main Results and Claims
- Constant client inbound bandwidth cost (`pirex`, `pirex+`)
- Low client online end-to-end delay (`pirex`, `pirex+`)
- Low client storage cost (`pirex+`)


### Performance Testcases

To obtain the results that support above claims,
we will measure the performance of our two schemes:

Under 03 types of blocksize
- 04KiB (`64` chunks of 64 bytes)
- 64KiB (`1024` chunks of 64 bytes)
- 256KiB (`4096` chunks of 64 bytes)

With 03 exponent range (base 2)
- [`18`, `20`, `22`, `24`, `26`, `28`]
- [`14`, `16`, `18`, `20`, `22`, `24`]
- [`12`, `14`, `16`, `18`, `20`, `22`]

This produce the following testcase:
- Small --> Database Size 1GiB - 4GiB
- Medium --> Database Size 16GiB - 64GiB
- Large --> Database Size 256GiB - 1024GiB

We have provided a `control.py` script to automate
this testing process with input: `small`, `medium`, `large`.
This script can help us to skip the offline phase and
directly measure breakdown cost of the online phase.



### Experiment Procedure

We recommend start with `small` then `medium` testcase,
since these cases only take upto 02 human hours with 
100GB disk space for storage in corresponding.

We will first need to randomize the client and server
data structure to simulate for all online phase using 
`src/helper.rs`. We can run a helper code as follow:
```
python3 config.py 64 24
cargo build --release 
./target/release/helper
```

This will create data structures that are enough for us
to first test the performace of `small`, `medium` cases.

We can then run the automate script `control.py` as follow:
```
python3 control.py pirex small
python3 control.py pirex medium
```

All breakdown cost will be logged inside `results` folder:
- Total client computation delay
- Total server computation delay
- In/Out bandwidth cost as number of bytes
- In/Out bandwidth delay (w.r.t the expected 40 Mbps)
- In/Out bandwidth delay (w.r.t your local environment)

Since `large` testcase can consume 1TB of storage disk 
to randomly create a database for testing, we recommend
checking your storage space first. If there is no conflict,
run as follow to setup data structure for the `large` cases:

```
python3 config.py 64 28
cargo build --release 
./target/release/helper
python3 control.py pirex large
```


For `pirex+`, we also recommend running the `small` and `medium` 
testcases first:
```
python3 control.py pirexx small
python3 control.py pirexx medium
```
